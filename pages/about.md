Blanchet House of Hospitality has been providing food and housing to the less fortunate of downtown Portland since 1952. An outgrowth of this mission, the Blanchet Farm in Carlton, Oregon has been operating since 1962 as a rural center of hospitality and recovery.

The 62-acre property is home to over 20 men in various stages of recovery from alcohol and drug abuse. Our daily life is designed to create an atmosphere of supported living that allows time for self-reflection on life choices and growth in accountability. Through their responsibilities and the farm and the shared community of the people around them, our guests are able to take the necessary steps towards becoming a self-sufficient and sober member of society.

A chief part of our working mission is our woodshop, where we have formal training programs to help our guests build useful skills while doing productive work. Many of the people who come to us have few marketable skills, or have burned too many bridges in their former trade. Through our program, we teach proper, safe woodworking techniques that not only produce the beautiful work you see here, but also teach the value of consistency, responsibility, and integrity. 

Many of the men in training are at different skill levels, and we constantly encourage an environment of "lifting up," to be supportive of each other rather than denigrating. We teach attention to detail, problem solving, patience, and teamwork. 

**Your purchase will directly make a difference in the lives of men working to rebuild themselves.**
