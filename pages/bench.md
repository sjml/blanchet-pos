We've taken the same level of thoughtful design that makes our chairs so special, and applied it to create a versatile bench that can be quickly made into a small table. Great for smaller patios or apartments where you may not have the space for a full dining set!

* The back of the bench swings smoothly forward on a reinforced hinge, before bracing itself against the seat. The hinge's durability is substantially improved by not having to support the weight of the wood. 

Two of the benches can even be combined into a full-sized picnic table!

All the products of our woodshop are uniquely designed, made with love, and a proud accomplishment of men who are actively fighting to get their life back on track. More than simply a piece of backyard furniture, they are a testament to the hard work and sacrifice of those fighting to stay clean and sober. 

Those fighting to create their own second chance. 

**Your purchase will directly make a difference in the lives of men working to rebuild themselves.**
