Blanchet Chairs are both built and designed by men in our recovery program. They resemble traditional Adirondack chairs, but there are several **key improvements**:

1. **Elevated seat for more comfortable usage.** Traditional Adirondacks have a very low seat and can be tricky to stand from. We have a unique leg style that elevates the seat, combining both comfort and ease of standing. 
2. **Curved back panel.** The back panels of the chair gently wrap around your back, almost like an embrace. Whether you choose to use a cushion or not, we've found them so comfortable that often we don't *want* to stand up.  
3. **Oversized proportions.** We got tired of feeling trapped and squished in traditional Adirondack chairs, so built these to feel spacious, with extra-wide arms to support both a coaster and beverage of your choice!
4. **Supporting recovery.** Most importantly, all the money received from sales of these chairs *goes directly back to the program*, helping to lift up the men in recovery at the Blanchet Farm.

All the products of our woodshop are uniquely designed, made with love, and a proud accomplishment of men who are actively fighting to get their life back on track. More than simply a piece of backyard furniture, they are a testament to the hard work and sacrifice of those fighting to stay clean and sober. 

Those fighting to create their own second chance. 

**Your purchase will directly make a difference in the lives of men working to rebuild themselves.**
