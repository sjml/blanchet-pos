This is the page about the various smaller gifts (cutting boards, etc.). 

We need, like, pictures and stuff to do the sell. 

But it will end with the standard footer:

All the products of our woodshop are uniquely designed, made with love, and a proud accomplishment of men who are actively fighting to get their life back on track. More than simply a piece of backyard furniture, they are a testament to the hard work and sacrifice of those fighting to stay clean and sober. 

Those fighting to create their own second chance. 

**Your purchase will directly make a difference in the lives of men working to rebuild themselves.**
