We've made an assortment of cutting boards and trivets, which make exellent smaller gifts to fit your budget and space. The same craftsmanship that goes into our furniture is applied to these items, so you can see beautiful patterns and inlays pieced together so skillfully that they seem like a single smooth piece.

All the products of our woodshop are uniquely designed, made with love, and a proud accomplishment of men who are actively fighting to get their life back on track. More than simply a piece of backyard furniture, they are a testament to the hard work and sacrifice of those fighting to stay clean and sober. 

Those fighting to create their own second chance. 

**Your purchase will directly make a difference in the lives of men working to rebuild themselves.**
